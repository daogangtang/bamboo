# 
In many cases, web applications need to interact with databases, traditionally, we use SQL sentences. But in bamboo, we use model to do the interaction, which increases the robustness.  
# Configuring the database
In settings.lua, WHICH_DB tells bamboo which database of redis you want to use. Defaultly, it is 0.  
If you want to use datebase 10, just write `WHICH_DB = 10`.  
# Your first model
Go to your project direction, then `cd models`, run `bamboo createmodel Mymodel`, you will find a file nemed `mymodel.lua` is generated like below.  
	
	module(..., package.seeall)

	local Model = require 'bamboo.model'

	local Mymodel = Model:extend {
    __tag = 'Bamboo.Model.Mymodel';
    __name = 'Mymodel';
    __desc = 'Generitic Mymodel definition';
    __indexfd = 'name',
    __fields = { 
		['name'] = {},  
    
    };  
    
    init = function (self, t)
		if not t then return self end 
    
		self.name = t.name
    
		return self
    end;

	}

	return Mymodel

`local Mymodel = Model:extend{...}` means Mymodel inherit from Model, the details of this oop feature is shown in Appendix A. `__tag` shows the inheriting order of Mymodel, `__name`, `__desc` shows the name and some description. `__indexfd` indicates the index field used by `getIdByIndex` and `getByIndex`(Pay attention, a field is set to `__indexfd` means the value of this field must be unique). `__fields` is a table cantains the field information of this model, `['name'] = {}` means field's name is 'name', `{}` is a table containing information about field `name` called FDT short for Field Describe Table. `init` function is like the a constructor.  
We want to add some fields, so we edit `__fields` like this:
	
	__fields = { 
		['name'] = {},  
		['age'] = {},
		['gender'] = {},
    };
	
Note: Each model has a primary key `id` auto-incremented.
# Use the model
To use this model, open `app/handler_entry.lua`, and add following sentences.  
	
	Mymodel = require 'models.mymodel'
	registerModel(Mymodel)

Note: In each module using Mymodel, `Mymodel = require 'models.mymodel'` is required.  
To use Mymodel to create an instance is like this: `inst = Mymodel{name='Young'}`. Then we can save it to the database by `inst:save()`, update it by `inst:update('gender', 'male')`. To delete the instance from database, use `inst:del()`.
To get this instance from database, just use `inst_got = Mymodel:getByIndex('Young')`, then we get this instance. 
More model and instance methods are shown at the end of this file.  
# Foreign field
In many cases, a model has a field linking to another instance. For example, a student model has a field `school` linking to a school model, on the other hand, the school model has a field `students` linking to the student model, they should be written in bamboo like this:  
	
	Student = Model:extend {
		...
		__fields = {
			...
			['school'] = {foreign='School', st='ONE'},
			...
		},
		...
	}
	
	School = Model:extend {
		...
		__fields = {
			...
			['students'] = {foreign='Student', st='MANY'},
			...
		},
		...
	}
	
As we see, the FDT of `Student`'s field `school` tells bamboo that this field is a foreign field linking to the `School` model, `st='ONE'` means a school instance is linked to a student instance. `st='MANY'` in the FDT of `School`'s field `students` means many student instances are linked to a school instance.  
Suppose that `stu_inst` is an instance of `Student`, `sch_inst` is an instance of `School`, you can add instance to a foreign field by `stu_inst:addForeign('school', sch_inst)` and `sch_inst:addForeign('students', stu_inst)`, delete by `stu_inst:delForeign('school', sch_inst)` and `sch_inst:delForeign('students', stu_inst)`.  
To get foreign instances, use `sch_inst_got = stu_inst:getForeign('school')`. Note that for `st='MANY'` condition, `sch_inst:getForeign('students')` returns a QuerySet(more information in Appendix A) of instances.
# Query
To get instances from database, you can use `model:getById(id)`, which is the basic function. Also, you can use `model:getByIndex(index)`, `model:all(is_rev)`, `model:filter(query, is_rev, starti, length, dir)`, those functions all call `model:getById(id)`.  
To query from database, you can use `model:get(query, is_rev, starti, length, dir)` or `model:filter(query, is_rev, starti, length, dir)`, where `query` is a table contains the query parameters. For example, to get the instances of `Mymodel` whose `gender` equals `male` and `age` is greater than 20, you can use `insts = Mymodel:filter({gender='male', age=gt(20)})`, `insts` is what you want.  
`gt(x)` stands for 'greater than x', like this, wo also offer `lt(x)` for 'less than x', `ge(x)` for 'greater than or equal to x', `le(x)` for 'less than or equal to x', `contains(x)` for 'contains substring x', `startsWith(x)` for 'starts with substring x', `endsWith(x)` for 'ends with substring x'.  
Note: `query` is not available for field `id`.
